# Financial Data Extraction Problem

## Background 
Development of Canoeâ€™s proprietary technology began in 2013 by a group of sophisticated
investors focused on alternative and illiquid strategies. They realized that it was difficult, costly
and time consuming to manually track all our own investments, so they decided to automate it.

## Deliverables
A model or a set of models that extracts key information from given documents.

## Business use case
Firms are inundated with data from hundreds of sponsors, all delivered disparately in
unstructured formats. The technology will help to deliver accurate data automatically extracted
from different types of documents and reduce errors and latency associated with manual data
entry.
